# PreventReload
A basic Chrome Extension that prevents a page from reloading when you click the toolbar icon.

Very useful for web developers who are working in the inspector stylesheet. We all have done that accidental refresh and lost **all** your hard work. With a simple click on the extension, the page will give you a confirmation if you accidentally attempt to navigate away.
